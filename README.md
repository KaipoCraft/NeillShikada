A portfolio website for the designer Neill Shikada


Welcome!

I have always wanted to learn how to code, so when it came to creating a portfolio website I jumped on the chance to try my hand.
After scouring YouTube, W3, and Lynda.com I've gotten a better grip on the whole thing. Feel free to try it out!
